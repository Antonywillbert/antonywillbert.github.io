### Welcome to My Digital Garden!

I’m **Antony Willbert**, on a continuous journey to become a better, kinder human. I find a sense of liberation at the top of a mountain after a hard climb and deeply value both physical and mental fitness. I cherish the company of people from all walks of life and love to hear their stories—every interaction is a window into someone else’s world, and that fascinates me.

In my professional life, I work in the **product space**, constantly exploring **product-building ideas** and the strategies behind them. Before diving into product management, I was a **sales team lead** role that taught me invaluable lessons in **human persuasion**, storytelling, and connecting with people on a deeper level.

For a long time, I wrestled with the question: _Should I share my thoughts with the world?_ I debated with myself and close friends. Should I post on Instagram? Should I write instead? What is the purpose? Am I seeking followers, or is there a deeper reason behind my urge to share?

After much reflection, the answer became clear: I’m not here to chase likes, algorithms, or followers. I want to share what has **impacted my life** in meaningful ways. If these lessons help even one person find relevance or guidance, that’s more than enough.

I believe in making each day count. Life is fleeting, and someday we will all be gone, but until then, I want to be useful to someone—a fellow human who are like me, is on a journey of growth.

### What Can You Expect Here?

I’ve always been curious about many things. Over time, I’ve realized that life can be broken down into **four key components**. These are what I focus on, and through this blog, I’ll be sharing my thoughts on each:

1. **Health**
2. **Mental Health (Peace of Mind)**
3. **Relationships**
4. **Wealth**
5. Product 
6. Sales

I’ve put **health** as my top priority and **wealth** at the bottom. Why? Because I’ve learned that when my health, mental peace, and relationships are in harmony, I’m confident in my ability to achieve the wealth I desire. But if any of these three are out of sync, I’m thrown off course.

So here I am, sharing my journey. Sometimes, I’ll write about these four areas, and other times, I’ll explore topics like books, personal stories, and anything else that makes me curious and interesting.

I’m not here to preach or ask you to follow any particular path. Like you, I’m learning. We all have unique experiences—what worked for me might not work for you, and that’s okay. This is simply a space for me to share what I’ve discovered, and maybe it’ll resonate with you in some way but you find your own path or truth.
