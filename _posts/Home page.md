Welcome to my digital garden !

I am Antony Willbert aspiring to be a better human probably be a kinder version on this planet. I find liberation in top of an mountain after a hard climb, love to be fit, physically and mentally and I cherish & enjoy company of fellow humans across globe, love to listen to their stories. 

Documenting things that helped me find things in this so constructed world might be even it could help people figure out things. 

Life has lots of components, I bucket that into 4 things, Which makes its complete excluding spirituality ? Why ? I find it more intense requires lot of dedication to live like a monk so I would skip that and I want to write on the below things which I strongly believe it can help you and it will make a great impact. 

The 4 Key aspects of life 
1. [Health]()
2. [Mental Health (Peace of mind)]()
3. [Relationship]()
4. [Wealth]() 

I have put Health as first priority and wealth as the last you could think I am stupid, Yes slightly I have realised over the course of my life when my health, mental peace and relationships are in line, I am very much in confidence to make the wealth I desire to but if any of the above three is not in sync I am on a toss. 

So here we are sometimes I might write about all of these in these website and some personal interested books, stories and what not anything that makes me live. 

- What would you do spending your time on this earth ? 
- Life is all about giving and we are just here by a lottery ?
